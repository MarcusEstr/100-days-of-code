# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed a variety of FreeCodeCamp challenges today, and fussed around with SQL to solve practice problems on HackerRank. Also started the 30 Days of Code thing there, too. Well, if I keep up the 100 days then I'll absolutely complete this one. Did the Hello World challenge in a few languages that I'm adequate on/learning (VB.NET, JavaScript, C#).

My obsession with seeking out e-learning websites and courses is giving me the vaguest idea for a project. In its most rudimentary form it would be a spreadsheet and in its most interesting (to me) it might be a website showing off the pros and cons of various resources /w pretty sortable table listing cost and course # or some such. 

**Thoughts:** Right now I have an ADDICTION to learning/accessing learning tools. Seriously. I keep dreaming about subscriptions or payments to courses on edX, Treehouse, and more. But I also have limited time to use these things. After all, my full time job begins in June - and I'm currently part time at two jobs right now. 

Still, the concept of learning on my own is desperately appealing for some reason. Although I took a handful of programming classes at school, it was only by the final C# course that I really felt I understood anything at all (well, aside from SQL classes - those were divine). Maybe I'm finally over the "hump" as far as grasping the core mechanics of code. There's still a long way to go, but exercises and projects are starting to become fun rather than confusing beyond belief.

Of particular note, I have an interest in picking up at [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) after getting through more of FreeCodeCamp's curriculum. 

Also, at some point wish to get a one month sub to [Pluralsight](https://billing.pluralsight.com/individual/checkout) to grab some videos. They offer stuff like CompTIA certifications. $29.99 per month.

Also also: Free web development learning using Ruby on Rails is available at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home).

**Time:** 2 hours and 42 minutes.
