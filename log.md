**Thoughts:** Right now I have an ADDICTION to learning/accessing learning tools. Seriously. I keep dreaming about subscriptions or payments to courses on edX, Treehouse, and more. But I also have limited time to use these things. After all, my full time job begins in June - and I'm currently part time at two jobs right now. 

Still, the concept of learning on my own is desperately appealing for some reason. Although I took a handful of programming classes at school, it was only by the final C# course that I really felt I understood anything at all (well, aside from SQL classes - those were divine). Maybe I'm finally over the "hump" as far as grasping the core mechanics of code. There's still a long way to go, but exercises and projects are starting to become fun rather than confusing beyond belief.

Of particular note, I have an interest in picking up at [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) after getting through more of FreeCodeCamp's curriculum.
