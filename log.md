# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed a variety of FreeCodeCamp challenges today, and fussed around with SQL to solve practice problems on HackerRank. Also started the 30 Days of Code thing there, too. Well, if I keep up the 100 days then I'll absolutely complete this one. Did the Hello World challenge in a few languages that I'm adequate on/learning (VB.NET, JavaScript, C#).

My obsession with seeking out e-learning websites and courses is giving me the vaguest idea for a project. In its most rudimentary form it would be a spreadsheet and in its most interesting (to me) it might be a website showing off the pros and cons of various resources /w pretty sortable table listing cost and course # or some such. 

**Thoughts:** Right now I have an ADDICTION to learning/accessing learning tools. Seriously. I keep dreaming about subscriptions or payments to courses on edX, Treehouse, and more. But I also have limited time to use these things. After all, my full time job begins in June - and I'm currently part time at two jobs right now. 

Still, the concept of learning on my own is desperately appealing for some reason. Although I took a handful of programming classes at school, it was only by the final C# course that I really felt I understood anything at all (well, aside from SQL classes - those were divine). Maybe I'm finally over the "hump" as far as grasping the core mechanics of code. There's still a long way to go, but exercises and projects are starting to become fun rather than confusing beyond belief.

Of particular note, I have an interest in picking up at [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) after getting through more of FreeCodeCamp's curriculum. 

Also, at some point wish to get a one month sub to [Pluralsight](https://billing.pluralsight.com/individual/checkout) to grab some videos. They offer stuff like CompTIA certifications. $29.99 per month.

Also also: Free web development learning using Ruby on Rails is available at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home).

**Time:** 2 hours and 42 minutes. 


### Day 2: May 11, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: TRan through a handful of JavaScript stuff on FreeCodeCamp during lunch. Then, fussed around with Day 1 of the HackerRank #30DaysofCode thing. For some reason I'd believed that yesterday was day 1 - guess it was day 0. Completed that in both VB.Net and JavaScript. These are just what I am most comfortable in right now. 

Also did a lot of un-timed researching about GitHub Pages for blogging. Maybe I'll jump back to that at some point, but it seems that honestly WordPress or Blogger would be better for my wishes at this point. Basically, I want to pursue something where I can just save my notes and have them TAGGED/easily accesible. Jekkyl is an interesting platform but one of its pitches is that it doesn't use a DB? But I love DBs lol. For now my notes will reside in Word documents. 

Creating the card counter thing on FreeCodeCamp was an interesting little exercise. I'd like to push that further with something that is actually useful or has a GUI. 

**Thoughts:** Here's what's up with 30DaysofCode - the notes and tutorials seem decently in depth but do not really tell you much of what you need to know. It is very far away from Codecademy/FreeCodeCamp which basically always gives you a sample very close to if not identical to what you'll need to do next. Both methods are valid ways to teach, with the former requiring a lot more outside research.

That's already something I do often enough at work so it's familiar here. But for someone truly new to coding 100%, I could see this is absolutely a stopping point so early on. It's really disheartening, honestly. If you want to teach people to code you REALLY need to start slow in some instances. Slower than that. Oh well.

**Time:** 2 hours and 27 minutes. 



### Day 3: May 12, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Clocked nearly an hour each on 30 Days of Code day 2, Learn.co's JavaScript fundamentals and FreeCodeCamp JavaScript stuff. Of everything, it is starting to feel like 30 Days of Code may be the most useful to me, as after giving brief descriptions you are basically left to complete a task on your own. Then again, that's like how HackerRank seems to function in general.

In comparison, as fun as FreeCodeCamp is, there's still the matter of practically being spoon-fed most of the time on the site. While you get stuff done you may not remember it.  I really need to go back and take more notes on my JavaScript stuff so far to keep track of it. Learn.co continues to bug me with its DOM focus - but that's probably actually a skill that is helpful - I just don't realize it yet.

**Thoughts** I'd love to put in a lot more time if I weren't all sore feeling from poor posture or something?? Not sure where that came from, but that's an issue to resolve hopefully. May end up taking a bit of a "break" in order to reset myself to a good standing. But I really do want to get back to my site. And I really want to create a site for Mother's Day - but that wouldn't likely meet mmy standards in the time remaining. Well, unless I could pull an all-day/nighter but not with these aches. 

**Time:** 2 hours and 49 minutes.

### Day 4: May 13, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the Basic JavaScript and Object Oriented and Functional Programming sections of FreeCodeCamp. It was certainly more of a challenge than previous sections, but nothing that awful came up. Of course, that means up next are the Basic Algorithm Problems. Trying my best to take those carefully, but it's certainly annoying when Google searches yield a specific response to these questions. I'd rather it be like at work where searching yields tidbits of knowledge rather than a full on solution. Obviously trying to avoid seeking out full answers.

Put in a bit of time with Learn.co, but I'm still unsure of this whole thing. The method of teaching is differnt. And while I Love the Learn.co IDE in theory, it's definitely showing its bugs. And, really, I should use my own IDE and GitHub if I'm serious about all this. For some reason I'm still having a lot of trouble wrapping my mind around the simple syntax, however. I'll get it figured out eventually. 

HackerRank continues to be interesting, though I do wish I could push through more days quicker if possible. 

**Thoughts** Welp I read one article about coding bootcamps and that showed me a host of other websites which offer coding challenges and tutorials/courses. So of course I sugned up for them all. Check the links below for easy reference... At the time of this writing I still have not received a registration/confirmation email from CodeEval, though, maybe that's for the best. I'm not at "that level" yet. 

**Time:** 5 hours and 26 minutes.

**Resources:**
1. [Coderbyte](https://coderbyte.com/) -- Really want to check out their "Learn X in one week" courses, as well as Bootcamp prep :P.
2. [Codility](https://codility.com/programmers/)
3. [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)
4. [CodeEval](https://www.codeeval.com)
5. [RubyMonk](https://rubymonk.com/)
6. Tool: [repl.it](https://repl.it/)


### Day 5: May 14, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent a fair amount of time fighting with the Learn.co IDE... Sort of. It does not seem to always update quickly, leading to failed builds despite being ready to go. In other occassions, I feel that my code will accomplish the goal but that they simply will only accept certain very specific things. It's annoying and counterintuitive to learning. And it's more of an issue than HackerRank's browser-based coding thing which still checks various test cases.

Beyond that, day 4 of #30DaysOfCode was another fun day. Aside from the first day things have actually been really enjoyable on there. Another change I made to my workflow as to create a [Wordpress blog](http://marcuscript.wordpress.com). It will hold my solutions - as well as my #100DaysofCode updates. That's a good thing as the GitHub long would really become untenable before long.

**Thoughts** My thoughts are that I'd really love to get a subscription to one learning site per month. The site must offer its video library to subscribers and (hopefully) also offer downloads to subscribers for me to choose them. 

**Time: ** 3 hours and 4 minutes.
