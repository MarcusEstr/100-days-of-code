# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed a variety of FreeCodeCamp challenges today, and fussed around with SQL to solve practice problems on HackerRank. Also started the 30 Days of Code thing there, too. Well, if I keep up the 100 days then I'll absolutely complete this one. Did the Hello World challenge in a few languages that I'm adequate on/learning (VB.NET, JavaScript, C#).

My obsession with seeking out e-learning websites and courses is giving me the vaguest idea for a project. In its most rudimentary form it would be a spreadsheet and in its most interesting (to me) it might be a website showing off the pros and cons of various resources /w pretty sortable table listing cost and course # or some such. 

**Thoughts:** Right now I have an ADDICTION to learning/accessing learning tools. Seriously. I keep dreaming about subscriptions or payments to courses on edX, Treehouse, and more. But I also have limited time to use these things. After all, my full time job begins in June - and I'm currently part time at two jobs right now. 

Still, the concept of learning on my own is desperately appealing for some reason. Although I took a handful of programming classes at school, it was only by the final C# course that I really felt I understood anything at all (well, aside from SQL classes - those were divine). Maybe I'm finally over the "hump" as far as grasping the core mechanics of code. There's still a long way to go, but exercises and projects are starting to become fun rather than confusing beyond belief.

Of particular note, I have an interest in picking up at [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) after getting through more of FreeCodeCamp's curriculum. 

Also, at some point wish to get a one month sub to [Pluralsight](https://billing.pluralsight.com/individual/checkout) to grab some videos. They offer stuff like CompTIA certifications. $29.99 per month.

Also also: Free web development learning using Ruby on Rails is available at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home).

**Time:** 2 hours and 42 minutes. 


### Day 2: May 11, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: TRan through a handful of JavaScript stuff on FreeCodeCamp during lunch. Then, fussed around with Day 1 of the HackerRank #30DaysofCode thing. For some reason I'd believed that yesterday was day 1 - guess it was day 0. Completed that in both VB.Net and JavaScript. These are just what I am most comfortable in right now. 

Also did a lot of un-timed researching about GitHub Pages for blogging. Maybe I'll jump back to that at some point, but it seems that honestly WordPress or Blogger would be better for my wishes at this point. Basically, I want to pursue something where I can just save my notes and have them TAGGED/easily accesible. Jekkyl is an interesting platform but one of its pitches is that it doesn't use a DB? But I love DBs lol. For now my notes will reside in Word documents. 

Creating the card counter thing on FreeCodeCamp was an interesting little exercise. I'd like to push that further with something that is actually useful or has a GUI. 

**Thoughts:** Here's what's up with 30DaysofCode - the notes and tutorials seem decently in depth but do not really tell you much of what you need to know. It is very far away from Codecademy/FreeCodeCamp which basically always gives you a sample very close to if not identical to what you'll need to do next. Both methods are valid ways to teach, with the former requiring a lot more outside research.

That's already something I do often enough at work so it's familiar here. But for someone truly new to coding 100%, I could see this is absolutely a stopping point so early on. It's really disheartening, honestly. If you want to teach people to code you REALLY need to start slow in some instances. Slower than that. Oh well.

**Time:** 2 hours and 27 minutes.
